# char_dev_driver
Developed a virtual character driver on Linux which invloves transferring and manipulating data to the device memory using normal read(), write() and lseek() calls.Implemented ioctl() and mmap() for data manipulation in the device memory and mapping of the device memory.Synchronization was added to the driver module to handle the race conditions.
